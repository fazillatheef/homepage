# Homepage
A simple [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) server app that can be used to serve a homepage in the local machine(localhost). Simple project to review flask knowledge. It uses sqlite to store links locally. It is more like a local bookmark database. This is just a demo project to practise writting a basic python web application.  

## Download
`git clone https://github.com/fazillatheef/homepage.git`

## Usage 
`python web_server.py`

Then open [localhost:2020](http://localhost:2020) in the browser.

> *__Tip:__ Add the command in Windows scheduler to start the program after logging in*
